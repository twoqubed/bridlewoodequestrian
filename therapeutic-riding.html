                    Stable Strides Farm, a nonprofit organization, was established in 2001 giving riders with disabilities
                    a place to learn to become effective and competitive horse people. In January of 2008 we moved to
                    Bridlewood Stables in Flower Mound, Texas. Our riders continue to be successful in the show arena. Our
                    lesson horses are retired show horses that have experience in all classes. We now have 8 horses in
                    the program with an average age of 13 years. They are all registered and have earned points in their
                    respective breed associations. Six of the eight horses have competed and placed in the top 5 at the world
                    show level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stable Strides has won several awards under the direction of Amanda Cleveland, including The Top Club
                    awards from Chisholm Challenge and Top Hands. Our riders have won several world titles in PHBA and ABRA
                    as well as 5 AQHA High Points for the Nation in AQHA EWD including the first ever Showmanship, WTC English
                    Equitation and WJL Western Horsemanship.

                    Riders at Stable Strides experience so many benefits from their time in the arena. Not only do they
                    get a since of pride from their accomplishments with the horse, but they also receive physical and
                    cognitive benefits. Our riders develop skills that give them bragging rights to their able-bodied peers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have heard riders speak their first words and seen them become strong enough to take their first
                    steps. Riders may be working on 3 step directions at school but be able to follow 10 step directions
                    with the horse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thank all of our donors, volunteers and parents for helping our students to get where they are in
                    their riding careers. Truly they have made a difference allowing our students to compete successfully
                    on a level playing field with all their peers.

                                Amanda grew up wanting her own horse.  It wasn't until she was a freshman in high school that her
                                parents gave her the best gift, a big gray thoroughbred named Regal Mac.  Amanda rode Mac in lessons
                                and showed on the NTHJC Circuit.  Amanda took Mac to college and enjoyed riding on the
                                St. Andrew's Equestrian Team.

                                Amanda is a NARHA Advanced Therapeutic Riding Instructor.  She attended college at St. Andrews
                                Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, North Carolina.  Upon completing all therapeutic riding classes,
                                she transferred and graduated from Texas Woman's University with a degree in Education. She received
                                her teaching certificate from the state of Texas in both Secondary and Special Education.

                                Amanda taught some in the classroom but found her place in the arena with her riders. Amanda and
                                her husband J founded Stable Strides Farm to allow riders with special needs to have a place to
                                learn to be competitive and talented horse people. Amanda says, "I hope to be doing this for a
                                long time. This is something that I believe in and hope to always be a part of. I learn so much
                                from each rider.  I love volunteering and watching our riders shine!"

                                Tracy Grucza has joined the Stable Strides Farm coaching team. She is a certified PATH Intl.
                                therapeutic riding coach. Tracy holds an Elementary Education Degree with a concentration in
                                Reading and Early Childhood. She also earned a Masters Degree in Elementary Education.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tracy’s love for horses started at an early age. She owned her own horse and rode on the open land
                                near her parent’s home in Pennsylvania. After taking an equine class in college, Tracy was
                                involved with an Appaloosa Farm and gave trail rides. She also spent a summer as lead instructor
                                at a Girl Scout camp. After marriage and two wonderful sons, Tracy found herself in Kentucky
                                and surrounded by horses. She lessoned in Hunter/Jumper and Saddle Seat riding. In her career
                                she was a stay at home mom, a second grade teacher, and was Director of a private pre-school,
                                pre-K, Kindergarten.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tracy moved to Texas with her husband in 2014. She knew horses needed a
                                special place in her life in Texas. She started taking lessons at Bridlewood Stables and Equestrian
                                Center. Tracy rides both Hunt Seat and Western. She looks forward to her lessons at the barn
                                twice a week. When Tracy was introduced to Stable Strides Farm Therapeutic program and the very
                                special and talented riders, the excitement of a new chapter was opened.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tracy started as a very enthusiastic volunteer. Her love for the riders and horses grew.
                                She felt the need to become more involved and dedicated to the magic that happened in the barn
                                as the riders and horses came together. Tracy started the PATH certification process. Today you
                                can find Tracy at the barn on most week days. She volunteers for the Stable Strides Farm program
                                on Mondays and Fridays and coaches on Tuesday through Thursday.

                                After years of volunteering for Stable Strides Farm, Savannah became a PATH Registered Instructor
                                in 2015. Prior to volunteering, she began with Stable Strides as a rider in 2002. Savannah has
                                worked with horses her whole life. She inherited her passion for horses from her grandparents
                                who were avid horseback riders. Savannah's Papa always let her ride and help take care of his
                                horses from the time she was very young. When she was eight years old she started taking lessons
                                with Ms. Mandy, Director of SSF. As Savannah got older she began to volunteer and eventually
                                preparing to become a certified riding instructor. As a teenager she showed in the Western Pleasure,
                                Western Horsemanship, Trail, English Equitation, Hunter Under Saddle, Showmanship, and Reining.
                                Her favorite class is the Pleasure. She loves showing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Savannah's passion for therapeutic riding started when she was a rider in the program. "I had
                                such crippling anxiety and my ADHD was so bad I could not focus. Through horseback riding I was
                                able to overcome a lot of my anxiety. With regards to my ADHD, riding really helped me become
                                more focused and able to channel my thoughts better in and out the arena." As she started
                                volunteering she grew to love working with horses even more as she was able to watch other people
                                grow and overcome many of their challenges. Savannah works hard but she doesn’t really consider
                                teaching work because she is doing what she loves, working around horses.
