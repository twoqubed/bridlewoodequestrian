                <h2>Hunter/Jumper Lesson Program</h2>
                <p>
                    For the novice to expert level rider, Bridlewood offers a Lesson Program to suit your Hunter/Jumper
                    goals. Our expert trainers have the patience to introduce beginners to the joys of riding and the
                    skill to fine-tune intermediate and advanced riders. Hunter/Jumper lessons are available 6 days per
                    week (we are closed on Mondays).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A covered, lighted arena allows for lessons during evening hours and inclement weather. Lessons are
                    45-60 minutes for private and semi-private groups; riders will be grouped according to experience.
                    School horses and tack are available for riders who do not yet own a horse or pony. All riders must
                    wear proper riding attire: ASTM/SEI approved helmet, riding breaches, a collared shirt, and paddock
                    boots with half-chaps or tall boots.

                <h2> Bridlewood Show Riders</h2>
                <p>
                    Students who have exhibited the ability to take their riding skills beyond the lesson ring are
                    invited to join the Bridlewood Show Riders. Bridlewood Show Riders typically own or lease their
                    horse or pony, but the barn has many lesson horses available for show lease as well. Riders have the
                    option to compete in any or all shows posted on the Bridlewood Show Riders schedule; approximately
                    15 shows each season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bridlewood is a member of the North Texas Hunter Jumper Club (NTHJC) circuit, but also competes in
                    THJA (Texas Hunter Jumper Association) “AA”,  “A” and “B” rated shows. Under the direction of our
                    trainers, riders practice Hunter and Equitation course work, Medal Tests, Jumper courses and
                    extensive flat work. Bridlewood Show Riders are required to ride in lessons a minimum of twice
                    weekly. Being one of Bridlewood Show Riders provides an excellent opportunity for challenging
                    themselves and their riding abilities on a grander scale while promoting camaraderie and teamwork
                    among those who show.

                        <p>
                            Shann Cranford has been riding horses since she was 9 and has been training horses since
                            she started her own horse, Phantom Trick (Tino) when she was just 13. She has successfully
                            campaigned horses to year end awards in the hunter, jumper, and equitation rings.
                        </p>
                        <p>Shann attended Texas A&M University where she graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Animal
                            Science and Biomedical Science. Following graduation, she has been on staff at hunter/jumper
                            barns in the Houston and DFW areas.  She currently serves as the Vice President of the Dallas
                            Hunter Jumper Scholarship Circuit and is a member of NTHJC, THJA, USEF, and USHJA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shann emphasizes professionalism and horsemanship as foundations for creating a safe, fun
                            environment for learning and development.  She particularly enjoys seeing her students and
                            young horses progress through the ranks and achieve their own measures of success.

                                Jessica's passion for horses took off when she began riding at the age of seven. She trained
                                under Britt McCormick during the last four years of her junior career where she learned the
                                ins and outs of the industry as well as took up a working student position. Jessica has been
                                successful in the hunter, equitation and jumper rings throughout the country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jessica places emphasis on mastering the basics, and having fun while doing so. She loves
                                watching as riders challenge themselves to become the best riders they can be.
                            </p>

                                Jessica graduated from Spring Creek Academy in 2016, jumping straight into her professional career.
