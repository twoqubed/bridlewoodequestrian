                <h2>Hunter/Jumper Lesson Program</h2>
                <p>
                    For the novice to expert level rider, Bridlewood offers a Lesson Program to suit your Hunter/Jumper
                    goals. Our expert trainers have the patience to introduce beginners to the joys of riding and the
                    skill to fine-tune intermediate and advanced riders. Hunter/Jumper lessons are available 6 days per
                    week (we are closed on Mondays).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A covered, lighted arena allows for lessons during evening hours and inclement weather. Lessons are
                    45-60 minutes for private and semi-private groups; riders will be grouped according to experience.
                    School horses and tack are available for riders who do not yet own a horse or pony. All riders must
                    wear proper riding attire: ASTM/SEI approved helmet, riding breaches, a collared shirt, and paddock
                    boots with half-chaps or tall boots.

                <h2> Bridlewood Show Riders</h2>
                <p>
                    Students who have exhibited the ability to take their riding skills beyond the lesson ring are
                    invited to join the Bridlewood Show Riders. Bridlewood Show Riders typically own or lease their
                    horse or pony, but the barn has many lesson horses available for show lease as well. Riders have the
                    option to compete in any or all shows posted on the Bridlewood Show Riders schedule; approximately
                    15 shows each season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bridlewood is a member of the North Texas Hunter Jumper Club (NTHJC) circuit, but also competes in
                    THJA (Texas Hunter Jumper Association) “AA”,  “A” and “B” rated shows. Under the direction of our
                    trainers, riders practice Hunter and Equitation course work, Medal Tests, Jumper courses and
                    extensive flat work. Bridlewood Show Riders are required to ride in lessons a minimum of twice
                    weekly. Being one of Bridlewood Show Riders provides an excellent opportunity for challenging
                    themselves and their riding abilities on a grander scale while promoting camaraderie and teamwork
                    among those who show.

                            campaigned horses to year end awards in the hunter, jumper, and equitation rings.

                            Caitlin Ader has owned and cared for ponies and horses almost her entire life. She grew up
                            around her mother’s horses, and began formal riding lessons on her first pony when she was six

                            Florida. Caitlin attended private school through the 8th grade, and then completed her education
                            in an online environment so as to have the flexibility to maintain her rigorous training and showing
                            schedule.

                            honors in both equitation over fences and on the flat, and also only the second student-athlete
